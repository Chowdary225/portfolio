## Adding Your Certificates:

### 1. Prepare Your Files:
- **Images**: Save certificate images (JPG, PNG) in `/certificates/images/`
- **PDFs**: Save certificate PDFs in `/certificates/pdfs/`
- **Naming**: Use consistent naming (e.g., "html_css_js.jpg" and "html_css_js.pdf")

### 2. Update Data File:
Edit `src/data/personalData.js` and update the certificates array:

```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  title: "HTML, CSS & JavaScript Certification",
  issuer: "FreeCodeCamp",
  date: "2024",
  description: "Complete web development certification...",
  skills: ["HTML5", "CSS3", "JavaScript"],
  credentialId: "fcc-12345",
  certificateImage: "/certificates/images/html_css_js.jpg",  // For viewing
  certificateFile: "/certificates/pdfs/html_css_js.pdf",    // For download
  verifyLink: "https://freecodecamp.org/verification/...",
  logo: "🌐",
  featured: true,
  completionDate: "January 15, 2024",
  validityPeriod: "Lifetime",
  certificateType: "Completion",
  duration: "300 hours",
  grade: "100%",
  instructorName: "FreeCodeCamp Team"
}
```

### 3. Certificate Features:
- **View Certificate**: Shows the certificate image in a modal
- **Download PDF**: Downloads the certificate PDF file
- **Verify Credential**: Links to verification page or shows credential ID

### 4. Supported Formats:
- **Images**: JPG, PNG, WEBP (for viewing in modal)
- **PDFs**: PDF files (for downloading)

### 5. Best Practices:
- Use high-resolution images (at least 1200px wide)
- Keep PDF file sizes reasonable (under 5MB)
- Use descriptive filenames
- Ensure certificate images are clearly readable
- Test both view and download functionality

## Example Workflow:
1. Receive certificate from course provider
2. Save image version to `/certificates/images/`
3. Save PDF version to `/certificates/pdfs/`
4. Update `personalData.js` with certificate details
5. Test view and download functionality
